There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very 
much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, "Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!" 
(when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, 
but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its 
waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed 
across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch 
to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and was just in 
time to see It pop Down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
